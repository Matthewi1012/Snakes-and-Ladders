# Snakes and Ladders: Platform Edition

This is a platform game built in **MIPS Assembly**, inspired by classic games where players control a character navigating across levels and avoiding obstacles to reach a final goal. In this game, the player controls a traveler who begins their journey at the top of a snake-infested building. The objective is to climb down ladders, avoid cobwebs and loose floorboards, and reach the bottom level, all while avoiding contact with snakes.
